# Advanced Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to predict outcomes using various regression models. The project makes use of ensemble methods, preprocessing pipelines, and hyperparameter tuning to build robust models. It is designed to handle complex datasets with missing values and categorical variables using state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn seaborn
```

If using Google Colab, the code to mount Google Drive is already included in the notebook.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in your preferred Jupyter environment.
3. Make sure to update the path to your dataset in the following line:
   ```python
   path = '/path/to/your/dataset/adverts.csv'
   ```
4. Run all cells in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, train machine learning models, and evaluate performance.

## Features
- **Multiple Regression Models**: Includes Gradient Boosting Regressor, Voting Regressor, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automatically handles missing data and categorical encoding using `SimpleImputer` and `OneHotEncoder`.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Leverages multiple algorithms combined through ensemble techniques.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses `GridSearchCV` to tune models for optimal performance.
- **Visualization**: Built-in plotting for data visualization and model performance metrics.

## Dataset
The project uses a CSV file (`adverts.csv`) stored in Google Drive. You will need to modify the path to point to your own copy of the dataset. The dataset should include features relevant for regression modeling.

## Modeling and Approach
This project follows the standard machine learning workflow:
1. **Data Loading**: Data is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing**: Missing values are imputed, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.
3. **Model Building**: Several regression models, including ensemble models, are built using scikit-learn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters are optimized using `GridSearchCV` to find the best model.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and preprocessing.

## Configuration
Ensure the following configurations:
- **Dataset Path**: Update the dataset path to match your local or cloud storage.
- **Google Drive Integration**: The project includes Google Colab support, so if running on Colab, ensure you have access to the appropriate Drive location.

## Examples
Hereâ€™s an example of running the notebook:
```python
# Importing the dataset
adv_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/dataset/adverts.csv')

# Running the GradientBoostingRegressor model
model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing Libraries**: Ensure all required libraries are installed. Run the `pip install` command for any missing dependencies.
- **Dataset Issues**: Ensure the path to the dataset is correct and that the dataset has the required format and features.
- **Model Performance**: If the model performance is suboptimal, consider tuning the hyperparameters further or trying additional preprocessing steps.
